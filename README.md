# Unreal Snippets
This repository contains a collection of snippets/utilities/helpers etc. I have typically developed while working on [Solarian](https://trello.com/b/sX1savc1/solarian-development). Some subfolders contain readme.txt files with details/context about the contents within.

## FAQ
### What's with the `##_` Prefixes?
It's good practice to apply project/company-specific naming conventions to your file/type names, for a variety of reasons:

* Avoids potential clashes with engine/3rd-party code
* Creates uniform naming conventions
* It looks good in Solution Explorer (arguably most critical)

I once had a game company called Stormtide, hence the `ST_` prefix. For code that I share between projects, this is the one I normally use. Solarian-specific code tends to uses the `HT_` prefix or a derivative thereof

### Will any of this compile as-is?
Unlikely. This is more of a dumping ground than a functional repository. If you plan to use the content for your own implementations, you may occasionally need to read between the lines or fill in the blanks yourself.
